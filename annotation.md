# Annotation activities

- For these activities, we will use the Hypothes.is annotator to make comments that everyone else can see!

- By now, you should all have hypothes.is accounts and be members of the nt-spring-2017 group. You should also have the hypothes.is extension installed on Chrome

- If you aren't finished with these preliminary steps, go back to https://github.com/nt-spring-2017/activities/blob/master/accounts.md

### Here are some genral hypothes.is instructions:

1. Using Chrome, go to the website you wish to annotate.
2. Using your mouse, select a block of text you would like to annotate
3. A small menu will pop up where you have selected text. Click the button that says "annotate."
4. If the Hypothes.is sidebar is hidden it will expand with a new text area where you can annotate
5. Use tags to note the category of your annotations. Descriptions below will ask you to use specific tags
6. Once you've finished writing your annotation, click the button to "Post to acdm-spring-2017"

### Annotation 1:

- For this annotation assignment, we want to focus on connecting two readings to Event[0] gameplay

- Nominate a note-taker to make annotations on ideas or statements that pertain to your experiences playing Event[0]
- In your annotation, explain how the statement is connected to your experience
- Connections can be points of similarity or difference.
- Each group should make at least five annotations on each article. The second article is a bit more difficult to connect, but do your best, and we'll go back through both articles as a class.
