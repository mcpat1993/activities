## Note-Taking: Why Bother?

Learning to take efficient, effective notes is a study skill that will help you enormously in any class. Note taking will help you participate more effectively and remember key material will ease. With well-constructed notes, you’ll find it takes less time to study for that big test, and yet your scores will tend to go up. For literature and other text-based papers, good notes will help you find a topic, refine it to a thesis statement, and construct a thorough draft. Note-taking is also considered an essential skill for effectiveness in almost any career.

## General Advice

“Research indicates that 80% of new material can be recalled if you review notes within the first 24 hours of presentation.” –Janet Jenkins, academictips.org

“When you are taking notes change the color of your pen! Don't write in blue or black ink. Writing in color will help you retain 50% - 80% more of the information without reading it a second time.” –Nicole Watts, academictips.org

## My Method

I recommend you try a simple method that I’ve been using for many years.

1. For a book, use a folded piece of paper as a bookmark. (Works fine with digital, too, but no real need to fold)
2. When you come across something worth taking notes on (see below for samples), write down a key word or phrase and a page number.
3. This will allow you to assemble a concise master “cheat sheet” that’s easy to refer to in class, or later when you’re drafting a paper.

## What to Take Notes On When Reading
1.	Anything you don’t understand
2.	Anything you find interesting or important (major themes, key plot moments, something you would like to talk about.)
3.	Interesting or unique uses of language
4.	Allusions (a reference to another text, famous person, event, etc. I recommend keeping track of these so you can look them up online later and evaluate their significance.)
5.	A pattern or recurring device you think you may want to write about later

## In class activity

Use the above method to take notes (using a sheet of paper) on the Aarseth reading. In any way you find intuitive, make it clear which category each note belongs to. If you have already taken notes, go back through them and copy over any notes that fit the criteria above.
Add new notes to address anything from the above list that isn't already in your notes. If you took notes for some other reason than items one through five above, create a new category for that note. We will share the results as a class when you are done.
