#Free-writing activity

Think of a time when you had to come up with something that was meant to be fun for someone else, or a group of other people (a party, a game, weekend plans, etc.). How did you approach the planning? What worked or didnâ€™t work? How did you use knowledge of the person or people to customize your plans?
