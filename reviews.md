## Problem Statements

This is really a game design activity but, gues what? The work of trying to understand a game isn't actually that different!

This exercise is take from our reading from "The Art of Game Design." Take a look at the page called "State the Problem" for additional background information. 
Instead of coming up with your own idea for a game, we will try this on an existing game.

Lens #12: The Lens of the Problem Statement

To use this lens, think of your game as the solution to a problem.

Working with a partner, choose a game that both of you have played. Ask yourselves these questions:

- What problem, or problems, [is this game] really trying to solve?
- Have I been making assumptions about this game that really have nothing to do with its true purpose?
- Is a game really the best solution? Why?
- How will I be able to tell if the problem is solved?

Defining the constraints and goals for your game as a problem statement can help move you to a clear game design much more quickly.

For example, Event[0] might be trying to solve tbe problem, "How do I make a fun, smart game about an artifically intelligent shipboard computer when we don't currently possess the technology to make computers artifically intelligent?" 

Or maybe the problem was "How do I make a cool puzzle/story game with a twist that isn't too overused?" and creating a shipboard AI was the solution.

Or maybe the problem was "How can I make a game that with a totally new kind of unreliable narrator?"

Or maybe it was, "How can I use a game to make people think more deeply about what AI is?"

Give this a try with another game. Once you have a better sense of what a game is trying to achieve, it's easier to evaluate how successful it is. Reviewers do this all the time. Sometimes they things like:

1. This game tries to be X and succeeds so it's great!
2. This game tries to do Y and fails so it's no so great.
3. This game tries to do Z and succeeds, but it should have tried to do something else. 
4. This game failed at its primary goal but is super cool in a different (perhaps accidental) way that I love. 

## Video Game Reviews Activity

Part I: Homework


Read the following video game reviews of Event[0]. Take notes/annotations using hypothes.is. Make particular note of interesting or very effective uses of language. The highlighting functionality of hypothes.is should work for all of these sites.

Part II: In Class 

In class on Tuesday, February 14, we will discuss as a group, how to apply our observations to our own writing. We will also do a focused free-write session that you may use as time to draft or continue working on your review.
