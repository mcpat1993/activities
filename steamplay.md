# Steamplay descriptions

- Steamplays take place in the DMAP classroom, located in Cathedral of Learning room 435. We will meet in 435 on those
days without coming to Lawrence Hall. If the door is locked, please just wait in the hallway until I arrive to let you in. I promise to be there soon!

- Steam, is installed on all the computers. You should log into your own account. Steam is very picky about registering a new device, so please be prepared 
to go through a bit of rigamarole. I promise to help! 

- Note: Please bring headphones!

## Steamplay 1

- Game: Event[0]

- Focus: As you play Event[0] in class, I'll prompt you to pause ocasionally and take notes on two topics: 

- I. How the game presents you with a text-based artifical intelligence

- II. How the game presents elements of both simulation and narrative (as Frasca describes them)
